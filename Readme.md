# Cobalt
Cobalt is an easy-to-use distribution of Linux built on Universal Blue. It's faithful to GNOME design principles and aims to provide a GNOME experience that's faithful to the original design intentions. Furthermore, it's atomic; like other Universal Blue spins, your system's essential files are protected to ensure system stability.

There are plans to include an application named Fusion that will make it easy to engage with atomic aspects of the system, including going so far as to allow modification of protected files through automatically-generated layered packages. As of right now, development hasn't begun on this software.

## Status

Cobalt is currently in very early development and shouldn't be used for non-developmental purposes. Contributions would be appreciated.

## Name Origin

When a name was being chosen for this project, "Cobalt" was made a candidate because of an affinity for the kobolds of D&D origin. There was no other reason. It was later found out that cobalt likely received its name by disgruntled miners who believed that the unwanted ore was mischievously created by mine spirits referred to kobel; sometimes said to be a type of kobold, or more accurately a gnome; making it a perfect fit as the name for a project focused on GNOME software.
